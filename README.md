# SWBFSpy Internet Master Server

Project by the SWBFModders community to rebuild the GameSpy master server software used to host game servers for Star Wars Battlefront (2004) and Star Wars Battlefront II (2005) on the PC, PS2, and XBOX. 
SWBFSpy is based on OpenSpy source codes. All the original GameSpy features such as Leaderboards are being added, in addition to several brand new features. 
The administrators and developers of SWBFSpy include [FC]Phobos and [FC]Wolf, who founded the SWBFSpy project in September 2013.

The official SWBFSpy website is http://info.SWBFSpy.org

I'll update this again soon.
