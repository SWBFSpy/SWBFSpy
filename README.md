SWBFSpy is a project managed by the SWBFModders community to replace the GameSpy master server software used to host game servers for Star Wars Battlefront (2004) and Star Wars Battlefront II (2005) on the PC, PS2, and XBOX. Phobos improved the OpenSpy source codes in order to restore full server browser functionality for multiplayer, including a leaderboards system. Players and Game Servers and must be whitelisted to connect to SWBFSpy and view the leaderboards, as a security measure to keep out trolls. Contact Phobos to request whitelisting.

The only administrators of SWBFSpy are [FC]Phobos and [FC]Wolf, who founded the SWBFSpy project in September 2013 after discussions of how to restore MP for SWBF since the GameSpy shut down in November 2012. [FC]Wolf helped with initial construction of the needed files, but went inactive in 2014. Since then [FC]Phobos has been the only admin of SWBFSpy, and finished the project in 2018-2019!

Phobos is the Administrator, Founder, Operations Manager, Technical Director, and Chief Executive Officer of our SWBFSpy Organization. The SWBF community and [FC] clan used OpenSpy, Tunngle, and EvolveHQ for years until all those went offline. Now thanks to Phobos, SWBFModders has ensured that SWBF multiplayer will stay alive for many more years! Our community has no plans to support games other than SWBF1 and SWBF2 unless more coders want to join the team to help.

The complete SWBFSpy source code, tools, setup tutorial, and leaderboards scripts are available only on SWBFModders.com for registered members who contributed to the project. Ask Phobos if you have any questions. Most of our source code can't be shared on GitHub due to hostility from jealous trolls who were never involved in the creation or administration of SWBFSpy. Don't be fooled by their lies and fake websites. Shortly after they saw the SWBFSpy shell .TGA files that Phobos posted in 2016, they unsucessfully tried to publicly plagiarize SWBFSpy from him and lock him out of his own creations, so eventually (after refusing more diplomatic solutions) they were banned from the community as a result.

Our servers are highly active now with awesome mods such as TWD ZeroFront continually being updated! Also, the banned imposters are still spreading lies and trying to frame Phobos for their own hostility as of 2019, and have still failed to plagiarize our leaderboards due to their lack of knowledge. Phobos was the first to work on adding SWBFSpy Leaderboards since posting about it in 2013 -- and also the first to finish building them -- anyone else who tries to take credit for them is a low troll. We also had to implement a Whitelist Firewall to keep out the pathetic trolls and server crashers who failed to hijack SWBFSpy from us.
