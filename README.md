# SWBFSpy Internet Master Server for Star Wars Battlefront
SWBFSpy

Project by the SWBFModders community to rebuild the GameSpy master server software used to host game servers for Star Wars Battlefront (2004) and Star Wars Battlefront II (2005) on the PC, PS2, and XBOX. 

SWBFSpy is based on OpenSpy source codes. All the original GameSpy features such as Leaderboards are being added, in addition to several brand new features. The administrators and developers of SWBFSpy include [FC]Phobos and [FC]Wolf, who founded the SWBFSpy project in September 2013. 

[FC]Wolf created the initial prototype files, but went inactive during 2014. Since then, [FC]Phobos has been the sole admin of SWBFSpy. Some of our source code can't be shared on GitHub due to certain trolls trying to steal our ideas & lock us out from our creations.

The official SWBFSpy website is http://info.SWBFSpy.org

I'll update this again soon.
